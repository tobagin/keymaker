## Configuration

### GSettings Schema

Key Maker uses GSettings for persistent configuration:

```bash
# View all settings (Development)
gsettings list-recursively io.github.tobagin.keysmith.Devel

# View all settings (Production)  
gsettings list-recursively io.github.tobagin.keysmith

# Change default key type
gsettings set io.github.tobagin.keysmith.Devel default-key-type 'rsa'

# Set default RSA bit size
gsettings set io.github.tobagin.keysmith.Devel default-rsa-bits 4096

# Toggle fingerprint display
gsettings set io.github.tobagin.keysmith.Devel show-fingerprints true

# Configure delete confirmations
gsettings set io.github.tobagin.keysmith.Devel confirm-deletions true
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Run with debug messages
G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all flatpak run io.github.tobagin.keysmith.Devel

# Or for production version
G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all flatpak run io.github.tobagin.keysmith
```

## Testing & Development

### Manual Testing

Test the application functionality:

```bash
# Build development version
./scripts/build.sh --dev

# Run with debug output
G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all flatpak run io.github.tobagin.keysmith.Devel

# Test key generation with different types
# Test preferences saving and loading  
# Test key detection and color coding
# Test delete confirmation behavior
```

### Code Quality

Key Maker uses modern Vala practices:

- **Memory safety**: Automatic memory management with reference counting
- **Type safety**: Strong typing with compile-time checks  
- **Blueprint UI**: Declarative UI definitions with compile-time validation
- **GObject integration**: Native GLib/GTK integration
- **Async/await**: Non-blocking operations for file I/O and subprocess calls

## Security

Key Maker follows strict security practices:

- **Never stores passphrases** - kept only in memory during operations
- **Delegates all cryptography** to system OpenSSH tools (ssh-keygen, ssh-add)
- **Secure file permissions** - private keys automatically set to 600
- **Input sanitization** - all user inputs validated before subprocess calls
- **No shell injection** - direct subprocess execution without shell interpretation
- **Sandboxed execution** - Flatpak provides additional security isolation
- **Minimal permissions** - Only requires SSH directory access and SSH agent socket

## Flatpak Architecture

Key Maker is designed as a Flatpak-first application:

**Development vs Production:**
- Separate app IDs: `io.github.tobagin.keysmith.Devel` vs `io.github.tobagin.keysmith`
- Independent settings and data directories
- Different branding and theming

**Permissions:**
```yaml
finish-args:
  - --share=network           # For ssh-copy-id operations
  - --share=ipc               # Required for GTK
  - --socket=x11              # X11 display access
  - --socket=wayland          # Wayland display access  
  - --socket=ssh-auth         # SSH agent communication
  - --filesystem=~/.ssh:create # SSH directory access
  - --talk-name=org.gnome.keyring     # Keyring integration
  - --talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets # Secret service
```
